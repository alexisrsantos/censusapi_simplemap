# Applied Demography Newsletter (September 2018)

This repository includes the code used to produce the map featured in the "Accessing data from the American Community Survey in R using the Census API, and producing a map. It includes [code](https://github.com/alexisrsantos/censusapi_simplemap/blob/master/code_PA.R) to produce a map of percent non-citizen population by county for Pennsylvania.

It also contains a code in which you can ["fill in the blanks"](https://github.com/alexisrsantos/censusapi_simplemap/blob/master/code_fill_in_the_blanks.R). This code will allow you to produce a map for a state and variable of interest. I have included detailed comments on this code on where to obtain the information required to "fill in the blanks". 

If you have any question please create and [issue](https://github.com/alexisrsantos/censusapi_simplemap/issues) and I will answer as soon as it is possible.
