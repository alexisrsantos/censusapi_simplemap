# Applied Demography Newsletter (September 2018)

This repository includes the code used to produce the map featured in the "Accessing data from the American Community Survey in R using the Census API, and producing a map. It contains a code that in which you can "fill in the blanks" that will allow you to produce a map for your state and variable of interest. 

If you have any question please create and [issue](https://github.com/alexisrsantos/censusapi_simplemap/issues) and I will answer as soon as it is possible.
